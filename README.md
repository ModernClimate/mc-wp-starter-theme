# Modern Climate Starter Theme
Starter WordPress theme. Features [Bootstrap for Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass), SCSS compiler, JS linting and minifying and class based functions.php

Requires a minimum of WordPress 5.3, PHP 7.4, and Composer 2

MC Starter Theme is built with **Composer** and **Gulp** usage in mind and is the recommended way to use this theme.

## What tools do I need to use the theme?
1. [Node.js](https://github.com/ModernClimate/mc-wp-starter-theme/wiki/Install-Node.js)
2. [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
3. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
4. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally)
5. [PHP](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php)

## Instructions
1. `$ nvm i` : Installs and switches to necessary node defined in `.nvmrc`
2. `$ yarn install` :  Install yarn packages _(postinstall will run composer install and gulp build)_

## Gulp Commands
All minified assets are created to the `/build/` directory of the theme.
ex: `yarn gulp styles` to run commands exported from gulpfile.js

`$ gulp` : Runs linters and PHPCS, then compiles both minified and non-minified assets
`$ gulp watch` : Watches assets/scss, assets/js, then compiles non-minified build assets
`$ gulp watchDev` : Watches assets/scss, assets/js, then compiles minified build assets
`$ gulp build` : Runs linters and PHPCS, then compiles minified assets
`$ gulp buildDev` : Runs linters and PHPCS, then compiles non-minified assets
`$ gulp js` : Compiles theme.min.js file from assets/js/theme directory.
`$ gulp jsDev` : Compiles theme.js file from assets/js/theme directory.
`$ gulp styles` : Compiles minified (_.min.css) files based on root scss files in assets/scss directory.
`$ gulp stylesDev` : Compiles non-minified files based on root scss files in assets/scss directory.
`$ gulp phpcs` : Runs PHP Code Sniffer on all *.php files within the theme directory.
`$ gulp phpcbf` : Runs PHP Code Beautifier on all *.php files within the theme directory.

## Composer notes
If you decide to update the `psr-4` namespace prefix, you can use dump-autoload to do that without having to go through an install or update.
```
composer dump-autoload
```
